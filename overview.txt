 [ clue's Arch Install Script ]

- This script installs all the software I need and configures the system.
! Automatic partitioning has not been added yet. You will have to configure partitions automatically with cfdisk. Automatic Partioning will be added soon.

! The DEFAULT keyboard layout will be set to br-abnt2 because I use a keyboard with the pt-BR (ABNT2) keyboard layout.

! This script will require you to type the disk you want to install arch on and will wipe it. Please make sure the disk you're gonna use does not have ANY important data.

=> This script will install:
